Decided to resurrect this dead blog of 5 years as I'm about to embark on a new chapter of my life.

I'm moving to another country.

Relocating has always been at the back of my mind. Singapore has its charms and quirks, but also its mehs and aiyos. It's not somewhere greener. I don't really like to say that the grass is greener on the other side. It's just a different colour: on one side, it's blue; the other, it's yellow. Nothing is truly green. Not in this life yet.

It's scary. It's exciting. It's joyous. It's sorrowful. So many emotions to deal with that they sort of cancel each other out. It's *null*. It's *infinite*.

But I do say, I'm absolutely happy that my significant other is 100% on board with this. Nothing short of full commitment from her will give me the certainty of strength to take on this challenge. Everyone else can disagree and I'll just turn a blind eye and a deaf ear. But her? She's the rock I stand on. If it crumbles, I'm just floating in space.

My 20s is dominated by my ignorance and stupidity. My 30s is dominated by fatherhood. Hopefuly my 40s will continue the journey of self-discovery and purification of the self, before I return to dust and meet my Creator.
