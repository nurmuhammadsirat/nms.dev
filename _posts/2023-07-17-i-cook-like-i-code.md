I realized I am cooking for myself more now than I used to. Probably because where I am right now, eating out is expensive and not that easy to get to.

I'm not that much of a cook though. I mean, I can cook to keep myself well-fed, but I am terrified of cooking for others. I don't think I can take that kind of pressure. What if it's not good enough? What if they don't like it? What if I __poison__ them!?

Seems like my Impostor Syndrome complex extends to not only my coding but my cooking as well.

When I cook, I rarely make stuff from scratch. There's so much pre-made pastes that I don't have to figure out what to blend in which proportions. Pre-made blended pastes are just like my beloved open-source libraries: people have already made them and I can simply use what I like. All I do is just glue them together: water, heat, paste and voila! Some nice curry to dip my prata in!

That prata is also instant prata btw..
