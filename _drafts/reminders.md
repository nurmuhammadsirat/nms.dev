When things are going bad, always remember to be patient.

When things are going good, and they seem to be going really well for me, always remember to be grateful for it.

There is a hadith that says: "The Prophet SAW said that whoever among you wakes up physically healthy, feeling safe and secure with yourself, and with food for the day, it is as though he has been given the whole world." ([*hasan*, Sunan Ibn Majah]())

It is really easy to get caught up in worldly matters. And it is even far easier to feel entitled, as though you are owed something for your efforts. One way to remind myself not to be this way, is to think about another hadith of the Prophet SAW.

"Look to those below you (ie. less fortunate than you) and do not look to those above you (ie. in wealth and status), for it is the best way not to belittle the favours of Allah." ([*sahih* Bukhari, *sahih* Muslim]())

Indeed we just need to look around us and notice that which is *not* there: the pavements and streets free from litter and dead leaves, the garbage can mysteriously emptied every week, the grass that never seems to grow, the trash that I throw down the chute every day but never seem to pile up anywhere. All of which requires labour that is invisible to the public and largely done by foreign labour, who are largely repressed and generally considered to be second class, being constrained by policies created by a ministry with a leader who is as emphatic as a rock (at the time of writing).

While I may not be someone who can influence policy, I remind myself that I can be kind to those within my sphere on influence: my family, my friends, my neighbours, the people I meet on ther street.

I'm not perfect, but I should never stop striving to be.
